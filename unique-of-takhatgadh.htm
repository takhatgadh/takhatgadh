													<h3>1.Samras Village</h3>
													<p>Takhatgadh has a tradition to decide their leaders without elections unanimously for any local  body;  it  may  be  the  panchayat  or  cooperative  society.  It  is a  “Samras”  village  since  its establishment long before  the State Government launched scheme of samras village. The  village community  themselves  decide  a  leader  for  any  local  organization  in  an  absolutely  democratic way.  It  can  be  seen  that  right  up  to  the  micro  level  of  wards  the  leaders  are  decided  in  a democratic manner by  consensus. Ward leaders  then  become  the second level leaders for the Panchayat  and  Cooperative  bodies.  Besides  ensuring  that  a  new generation  of  leadership  gets practical experience, the system doesnot  allowwastage of  money for elections.</p>

													<h3>2. Peace Loving Village</h3>
													<p>The mechanism the  villagers  have developed for deciding leaders is useful for grievance redressal also. For any type of dispute be it  social, political or financial the village has an inbuilt conflict  resolution  mechanism.    Since  establishment  of  Takhatgadh  one cannot  find  any  court case filed by  villagers against each other. On visiting the village, it was noted that villagers state they do not fight with each other; only fight with situations for the purpose of development only. People of Takhatgadh are peace loving and entrepreneurialproving themselves in different fields.</p>

													<h3>3. United for Development</h3>
													<p>People  of  Takhatgadh  are  always  ready  to  grab  the  opportunity  for  development. Throughout the world now we can observe the scenario that people are fighting with each other for very small and petty issues and even brothers of one family for small piece of  land  going to the  extent  of  murdering  each  other.  Takhatgadh  people  and  leaders have  set  an  example  like Sardar Vallabh bhai  Patel  by  converting  small  pieces  of  land  at different  locations  into  big holdings of individual farmers. Voluntarily they have exchanged their small holdings of different locations  and  directions  with  each  other  to  convert  it  into  single large  holding.  Differences  of cost of land were paid to either side considering cost of particular piece of land. After having large holdings of land at particular point they made tube wells of ownership to develop irrigated agriculture. The economies of scale have been realized favourably in the village.</p>

Sale of Bidi, Tobacco, Cigarette, Wine, Snuff and  other  substances which are used for addiction is voluntarilyrestricted in  the  village.  Youth  of  the  village  are  safe  because  of  this  kind of  voluntaryaction  and  their energy is canalized in positive developments.</p>

													<h3>5. Health Sector</h3>
													<p>The  village  is  far  from  the  district  and  block  headquarters  where  medical  facilities  are
available. In the 1980s the villagers  noted that the road link did not allow for quick medical and
emergency treatments at these hospitals  of block or district  level.    To overcome the problem one
charitable trust was registered as “TakhatgadhAarogyaMandal”. It was announced to raise fund
from  and nearby villages and started to collect fund by trust. Record collection was made with
participatory  approach  and  25,  00,  000/-  Rupees  were  collected  for  the  building  of  hospital.
Somehow it was came to knowledge of trust that for such type of assets at village level there is a
scheme  in  which  they  can  get  support  of  Rs.  10,  00,  000/-  from  government  if  villagers
contribute Rs. 25,00,000/-. Trust applied and received support amount from government. Thus
villagers constructed hospital building at the cost  of Rs.35,00,000/-.  This hospital building has
facilities of a Community Health Center (CHC) level, but it was found difficult by trustees to run
CHC  with  recurring  expenses  ofmaintainenance.  The  village  made  an    offer  to  the    State
Government  to  run  a  CHC  in  this  building  with  the
stipulation  of  better  services  to  people.  Villagers
invited  the  concerned  minister,  secretary  and  staff  of
health department in village to study the situation and
hand over the building for CHC with two conditions.
The  first  condition  is  that  the  CHC  must  treat  all patients equally irrespectiveof  caste  and economic status.  The second condition is  if government
do not run it properly with right spirit, then  the Trust can take it back.  However the Trust  still
supervises and monitors the  overall working of the CHC.</p>
													<p>CHC  is  now  working  at  village  level  better  then  block  level.  Total  staff  strength  is  24
including Superintendent, 3 medical officer, 7 sisters, 4 visiting specialists and supporting staff.
Almost 100 OPD patients are visiting CHC daily  for consultation  and treatments from village
and  nearby  villages  of  district.  Surgeon  of  CHC  is  doing  average  20  operations  per  month  at
local  level.  Facilities  for  X-Ray,  sonography,  laboratory  for  investigating  tests,  ambulance
services,  Operation Theater and 35 beds for indoor patients are available at CHC.  All services
including food for indoor patients are free of cost at CHC with support of the Trust.
													</p>
													<p>The  President  of  the  Trust  Mr.DevjibhaiArjanbhai  Patel  and  Secretary
Mr.GanpatbhaiVeljibhai Patel are active and enthusiastic  in  working  for CHC; during the field
visit  they  informed  that  land  for  CHC  staff  quarters  was  spared  free  of  cost  by
villagers.Dr.JayantUperiya,  General Surgeon  expressed his feelings that trustees and people of
Takhatgadh are very cooperative and loving, and hence he has spent the last 17 years at this CHC
and  his  children  have  also  become  doctors  even  though  we  are  stationed  at  such  a  small  and
remote village and their schooling was in same village.</p>

													<h3>6. Agriculture Sector</h3>
													<p>Villagers were doing rain fed agriculture in the beginning due to less rainfall. They were
facing acute shortage of drinking water in spite of having 100 feet depth well for drinking water.
During the year 1957-58 first time tube well was made successfully with the help of Local Board
for  drinking  water  and  new  dimension  was  opened  for  irrigated  agriculture.  Farmers  of
Takhatgadh started to make tube wells for the purpose
of irrigation when they were connected with electricity.
Cultivation  scenario  was  changed  due  to  adoption  of
new hybrid variety of cotton -4. Suitable soil profile of
land  and  hard  working  of  farmers  was  producing bumper  crop  of  cotton-4  with  extra  ordinary  quality.  During  seventies  cotton  of  village
Takhatgadh was  in high demand (Quality &  Quantity both) at Bombay and Coimbatore cotton
markets named as  ‘Takhatgadh  Brand’. It made farmers of village Takhatgadh  economically
strong.  100  %  land  of  village  Takhatgadh  was  covered  under  irrigation  by  tube  wells  due  to
electricity  connectivity.  They  started  to  cultivate  groundnut  and  maize  in  addition  to  hybrid
cotton.</p><p>Farmers of Takhatgadh faced  a downturn in 1980s. Due to problem of white-fly in the
year 1982-83 total crop of cotton failed. They stopped growing cotton but during 1986-87 they
faced  scarcity  of  water  due  to  drought  conditions  and  cropping  pattern  was  changed
automatically for their survival. They started to cultivate spices and  oilseeds like; cumin, fennel,
and  caster.  Decreasing  level  of  surface  water  and  ground  water  lead  farmers  to  adopt  drip
irrigation and more than 65% farmers have adopted drip irrigation considering conservation of
resources and survival. Now farmers have started to grow variety of crops with drip irrigation
like; cotton, cumin, fennel, groundnut, potato, tomato, castor, and watermelon. </p>

													<h3>7. Irrigation Sector</h3>
													<p>The innovativeness and challenging nature of farmers of village Takhatgadhkeeps them
ready for facing any kind of problem. Due to depletion of ground water they formed an irrigation
society in the year 2005.Irrigation society  has set a unique example of unity and cooperation for
getting  and  distributing  water  and  formed  a  pattern  by  doing  this.  This  irrigation  society  has
requested  the  State  Government  to  spare  them  water  of  Narmada  River,  which  government  is
collecting in Fatehpura pond through Guhai pipeline from Dehgamwhich  is 4 kilometers away
from their village.  The State Government  has sanctioned this subject to the condition  in October
2010of  compulsory drip system,  the cost of  pipeline of 4 kilometers, water  storage, and water
distribution to be borne and managed by the village community.</p>
<p>Irrigation  Society  has  not  only  agreed  to  the
conditions  of  government  but  made  their  own
strategy  to  overcome  everything.  They  decided  to
make  four  pipelines  instead  of  one  pipeline  of  4
kilometers  with  10”diameter,  at  the  cost  of  rupees
One  Crorewithout any  financial support of  government or  any other organization.  They  were
committed  to  solve  irrigation  problem  permanently.  Society  decided  to  collect  contribution  of
Rupees  3300/-  per  land  holding  of  one  Bigah  and  have  completed    the  work  of  laying  down
pipeline successfully  with 100% peoples participation. 10 check dams and 3 ponds are common
properties of community, which they have decided to use for storage of water and not to waste
for new construction. Now they have to distribute the water up to individual farms  for that once
again they have  decided to get contribution of Rupees  One  Crore, which is also equal for all
without consideration of distance of farms from storage locations. It reflects unity of villagers for
any kind of challenge. </p>

													<h3>8. Cooperative Sector</h3>
													<p>Takhatgadh  Group  Service  Cooperative  Society  ltd.
was established in the year 1962. They are giving short term,
medium  term  and  long  term  loans,  which  amounts  Rs.3.27
crore per annum.  The  Society hasa    reserve fund of Rs. one
crore.  It is therefore a  financially sound cooperative society.
However  just    financial  soundness  does  not  work,  and  the
Society ensures the  quality andinnovative use of credit for members. Takhatgadh village has 100
tractors. Farmers were facing difficulty to go 10 to 20 kilometers to get dieselfor their vehicles.
Society found solution to this issue by purchasing one tanker of 4000 liters. They started service
of  sale of diesel without profit (cost to cost) to farmers. Society is purchasing diesel twice in the
month  and  distributing  to  farmers,  which  is  really  unique  idea  to  serve  the  members.  Second
welfare service is to issue the cheque of Rupees 5000/- on death of any member.</p><p>The  Takhatgadh  Milk  Producing  Cooperative  Society  Ltd.
is  also  progressive.  Dr.  Chandubhai  Patel  is  Chairman  of  the
society  and  has  been  unanimously  elected.  Government  started
reservation for women in cooperative societies from 2001 but here
in  this society woman  members are from 1995 in governing body.
Society  is  doing  milk  sale  of  Rs.75,00,000/-per  year  and
distributing handsome dividend to members. </p>

													<h3>9. Panchayat</h3>
													<p>Sarpanch says that it was no source village when panchayat was started here in village
Takhatgadh,  but  now  it  is  the  most  resourceful  village  and  panchayat.Takhatgadh  gram
panchayat  received  award  for  Best  Gram  Panchayat  at  District  level  in  the  year
1979.Takhatgadh gram panchayat received award for  Nirmal Gram panchayat  at District level
in  the  year  2010-11.  Apart  from  awards  Takhatgadh  is  having  CC   roads  in  all  streets,  own
anganwadi building, pick up stand, drinking water stand, 100% street light, 100% electricity,  and
100% houses covered with water tap.</p><p>Villagers  were  facing  acute  problem  of  drinking  water  but  in  favor  of  villagers  one
farmer donated 3 Guntha land at 3 Km.distance to panchayat and transferred in the name of gram
panchayat for creating drinking water facility. Now due to this favor by one villager the problem
of drinking water has been solved  and the village is  getting drinking water for 24 hours with the
help of a 20 HP motor. </p>
<p>Villagers take pride in stating  that our panchayat has
arranged  the  collection of  solid waste by tricycle on regular
basis and given dustbin to each and every  household that  is
why our village is clean. It is also decided where it should be
dumped  and  pits  are  created  for  this  special  purpose.
Moreover  panchayat  has  covered  whole  village  with
underground  drainage  line,  which  helps  villagers  keeping
village clean.</p>
<p>All  records  of  panchayat  are  computerized  and
classified  as  per  government  rules.  Panchayat  is  efficiently
collecting  100%  panchayat  tax  and  now  financially  sound
with the balance of Rs.2,50,000/-.</p>
